I had taken Flutter Developer Internship at Concern Society Nepal, located in Dharan, where I am working as part of the Flutter development team. This internship began on 20 June 2024 and focuses on developing cross-platform mobile applications using the Flutter framework. My responsibilities include designing UI components, implementing responsive layouts, and integrating Supabase as the backend service. I actively collaborate with the design and backend teams to build functional, real-world projects. Through this placement, I am enhancing my skills in advanced Flutter concepts, effective code structuring, state management (including Bloc), and version control using Git and GitHub. I also aim to improve my communication, problem-solving, and time management abilities by engaging in team discussions, resolving development issues, and following a structured task plan. This internship is a valuable opportunity to apply my technical knowledge, learn new tools, and contribute to meaningful software development projects.
